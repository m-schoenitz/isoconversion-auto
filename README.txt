Export all data from the DSC/TG.
-- Export them as CSV files
-- Make one file per measurement (do not combine files).

Make a folder and put the data files from the DSC/TG in it.

This folder must be inside the folder where the Matlab code files are.

In Matlab, run the file "processOneMaterial"
-- If needed, you can set some parameters in the top section of the code file.
-- If needed, you can exclude data files by moving them to a different folder in the explorer.

Your results will be in the file "isoconv_results.mat" and in "output.xls" inside the folder with the data files.

Ask if you have questions.
